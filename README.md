# JAX/FLAX Reinforcement Learning Agents

I created this repo in an attempt to learn JAX by implementing reinforcement learning algorithms made to work with openAI gym environments, I hope to use those in my Masters research experiments. I am also using this repo to experiment on git management approaches.
